# Reverted Mode #

## What is Reverted Mode? ##

SmokeDetector switches to Reverted Mode when it detects that errors occur in the running version: it goes back to a previous version. When SmokeDetector is in reverted mode, any privileged user can switch back to the master branch using the `!!/master` command when that's necessary.
