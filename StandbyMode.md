# Standby mode

## What is standby mode?

SmokeDectector can be run in standby mode as a backup copy just in case the main Smokey breaks down.
While in Standby mode, SmokeDetector will not make reports in chat, send posts to Metasmoke or listen
to commands.

Standby mode can be deactivated by running the `!!/failover` command. This will make the backup 
instance begin to run like the standard SmokeDetector.
