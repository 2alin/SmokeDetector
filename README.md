SmokeDetector
=============

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Charcoal-SE/SmokeDetector.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Charcoal-SE/SmokeDetector) [![Circle CI](https://circleci.com/gh/Charcoal-SE/SmokeDetector.svg?style=shield)](https://circleci.com/gh/Charcoal-SE/SmokeDetector)

Headless chatbot that detects spam and posts it to chatrooms. Uses [ChatExchange](https://github.com/Manishearth/ChatExchange) takes questions from the Stack Exchange [realtime tab](http://stackexchange.com/questions?tab=realtime), and accesses answers via the [Stack Exchange API](http://api.stackexchange.com/).

User documentation is in the
[GitHub wiki](https://github.com/Charcoal-SE/SmokeDetector/wiki).

To set up, use

```
git clone https://github.com/Charcoal-SE/SmokeDetector.git
cd SmokeDetector
git submodule init
git submodule update
sudo pip install pip --upgrade
sudo pip install beautifulsoup4
sudo pip install requests --upgrade
sudo pip install websocket-client --upgrade
sudo pip install phonenumbers
sudo pip install regex
sudo pip install termcolor
```

To run, use `nocrash.sh` (preferably in a daemon-able mode, like a `screen` session.)
You can also use `python ws.py`, but then SmokeDetector will be shut down after 6 hours; when running from `nocrash.sh`, it will be restarted. (This is to be sure that closed websockets, if any, are reopened)


You can run `. ChatExchange/setp.sh` to set local environment variables so that you don't have to log in every time. 

SmokeDetector only supports Stack Exchange OpenIDs for now.
